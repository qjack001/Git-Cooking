\### Notes



<!-- write any loose notes below -->



I used a 12 inch cast iron, but you can use it with any size round baking dish. If you’re using a 9 inch pan, **halve the recipe**, then cook at 400F for 20-25 minutes.

The herbs give a fairly strong flavour so use less if you don’t want it to be so dominant. 

Good toasted with butter, really good paired with chili!
