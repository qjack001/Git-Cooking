## Instructions

<!-- list the steps below -->

- Mix yeast, 1.5 tbsp yeast, and 1 cup warm water in a small bowl
- Cover with a towel and let foam if worried about yeast being dead
- In as big a bowl as you own, mix salt, flour, 1 cup sugar, and 2 egg yolks 
- Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture + 2 cups warm water
- Add 1/4 cup oil
- Knead for 10 minutes, adding another 1/4 cup oil throughout 
  - If adding raisins, this is a good step to add them in, but can also add when kneading later
  - If too much dough to work with at once, you can divide it in two since the recipe makes 2 loaves
- Cover, let sit for 15 minutes in warm spot
- Knead ~5 more minutes, oil hands first and add oil as needed
  - Dough should be smooth/satiny
- Coat dough ball in oil, let sit covered for 1 hour in warm spot
- Punch down dough, flip over, let sit covered for another hour
- Preheat oven to 375F right before wait time is over
- Punch down dough, if you haven't divided them already then divide into two loaves
- Braid dough as desired
  - My favourite is the [4 braid round challah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj8tuQ1RojM)
- Brush challahs with beaten egg and sprinkle with sesame and/or poppy seeds
- Bake at 375F for 10 minutes, then lower oven to 350F and back for additional 35-45 minutes, until challah tops are dark golden brown
  - Can also tap bottom or make sure internal temp is 190-200Â°
- Wait until cooled (at least slightly)
