<section markdown="1">

## Ingredients

- 1g of clove
- 2g of cinnamon
- 2g of ground ginger
- 3g of cocoa nibs

## Instructions

1. This recipe works best with the coffee you already enjoy; choose the roast you perfer, grind it at the setting you perfer, and use the amount of water you would usually use for 20g, boiled to the temp. you perfer.
2. Toast the cloves, cinnamon, and cocoa nibs in a pan
3. While still hot, grind the spices together (I used a spice grinder, but use what you have)
4. Add the ground spices, ground ginger, and ground coffee into a French Press and bloom the mixture
5. Add the rest of the water and place the lid on (but don't press)
6. Wait 2 minutes, then pour the French Press out (without straining) into a Hario with an unbleached filter
7. Let drain and then drink

### Notes

At the very least, this isn't a subtley flavoured coffee. Quinn found the ginger too strong, so maybe start with a little less and work your way up, if you're willing to make this more than once.
