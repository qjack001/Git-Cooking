You need one of those Vietnamese coffee filters to make this. Also, a Robusta works best (Trung Nguyen, if your local mart has it), but use a medium or dark roast otherwise.

## Ingredients

- 15g of coffee
- 15g sweetened condensed milk
- 90ml of hot water (~95°, but honestly I doubt it matters)

## Instructions

1. Grind the coffee to a medium coarseness (I do a #5 on the Ode)
2. Pour the grounds into the press and lightly compress with the little compressor disk
3. Add the sweetened condensed milk to the bottom of your mug, and place the coffee filter on top
4. With the compressor disk still in the device, bloom the coffee with about 15ml of water
5. Add the rest of the water and let drip through with the lid on (if your device has a lid)
6. Stir the coffee well, before pouring over ice—or drink straight from the mug if you perfer it hot

### Notes

I could only find volumetric recipes online, so this is a weighed-out version of the more authentic looking ones I could find. I make it a little sweeter than recommended (8g – 10g seems to be more traditional), but I'm looking to have a sweet coffee when I have this.
