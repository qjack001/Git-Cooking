## Instuctions

1. Put the bacon in a pan on medium-low heat
1. Filet the chicken breasts thinnly, preparing ~2 per Club
2. Throw the chicken on a hot pan and cover
3. Cut a couple of thin tomato slices, and break-off a few pieces of lettuce
4. Thickly mayo both buns and, on a diffrent pan (or you can try re-using a pan if one has become availible), fry the buns on medium heat
5. Flip the chicken over (once it is cooked on that side) and cover it in *Frank's*â€”put the lid back on because it will start smoking a ton
6. Get a slice of the cheese and place on top of the chicken, put the lid back on
7. Once the mayo-ed buns are looking golden brown, take them off the pan and place them on the plate
8. Construct the club, from the bottom-up: chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato

### Notes

Don't try to be fancy. Any "improvment" to the ingredients will be a downgrade in overall quality of the final result. If need-be, replace the processed cheese with just regular cheddar.
