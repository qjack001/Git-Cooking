## Instructions

#### Preheat the oven
1. Preheat the oven to 325 F

#### Preparing the Brisket

1. If brisket was in the frige, remove 0.5 - 1 hour before you plan on starting to cook
2. Once removed from the fridge, dry the brisket with paper towel and generously salt all sides
3. Heat an oven-safe, large high-walled pan or pot to medium high heat (use a pan/pot with an oven-safe lid)
4. Add enough oil to the pan or pot to lightly coat the bottom
5. When oil is nearly smoking hot place the brisket into the pan slowly, fat side down
6. Sear the brisket on all sides, flipping when the side that was being seared turns golden-dark brown
7. Once all sides are seared, take brisket out of the pan or pot and set aside


#### Braising

1. Place in carrots, onions and celery into the brisket pan
2. Stir vigorously and turn down heat to medium
3. Once the vegetables begin to fry (i.e. when most of the water has been boiled off), add in the tomato paste
4. Once the tomaoto paste is toasted (not burned!) stir in the red wine slowly to deglaze the pan
5. Place the brisket back into the middle of the pan fat side up
6. Add the beef stock, leave the fat side unsubmerged 
7. Bring liquid to a boil
8. Add bay leaves to the braising liquid
9. Cover 3/4 - 2/3 of the pot/pan with a lid or tinfoil
10. Place partially covered pot/pan into preheated oven
11. Braise in the oven for at least 4 hours. Monitor state of braising liquid. If it is evaporating too quicly add in more stock. 
12. Remove pot from the oven. 
13. Remove the bay leaves
14. Remove and seperate the braising liquid, brisket and veggies
15. Pepper the brisket, cover in tin foil. Let rest for 5 minutes.

#### Making the Brisket Sauce (Optional)
1. Place braising liquid in small pot
2. Bring liquid to boil
3. Stir frequently until liquid becomes condensed (use the "back of spoon" test)
4. Add pepper to taste

#### Serving
1. Slice brisket thinly
2. Plate veggies and sliced brisket
3. Add sauce on top of brisket and/or veggies

### Notes
This involves a lot of condensing of flavours. Adding salt early to the braising liquid is risky. Add salt at the end.
