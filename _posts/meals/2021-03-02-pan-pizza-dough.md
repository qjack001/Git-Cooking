Ingredients for a 10 Inch Pan


<section markdown="1">

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (120g) flour + more for kneading 
- 1/2 tsp (3g) salt
- 1/2 tsp (2-3g) sugar
- 1/2 tsp (1-2g) dried yeast
- 1/4 tsp (1g) garlic powder (very optional)
- 2 tsp (10mL) olive oil
- 1/2 cup (120mL) milk (water is fine instead)

## Directions

1. In a bowl combine all the dough ingredients. If it's too wet to knead, add more flour, but try to keep the dough as sticky as you can handle  
2. Knead until smooth and elastic (hard to time but try to get a good gluten window aka when you can stretch it and see light through it with out it tearing).
3. Cover and let it double in size, 1-2 hours. (You can also simply throw it in the refrigerator and let it rise slowly for 1-7 days.)

### Notes

A good tip if cooking in a pan you can cook the bottom a bit before topping to help brown the botttom more but not required.
