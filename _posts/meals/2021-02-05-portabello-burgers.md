## Instructions

1. Remove stem from mushroom cap and clean the mushroom
2. Mix vinegar, oil, soy sauce, garlic, and salt/pepper/msg to make a marinade
3. Soak mushrooms in marinade for at least half an hour
4. Bake mushrooms in the oven at 350 farenheit for 10-15 minutes or until tender all the way through
5. Sear the mushrooms on a hot cast iron skillet with a tablespoon of ghee for a few minutes on each side 
6. Melt cheese onto mushrooms, toast and butter buns, and assemble burgers with any other desired toppings (I like to add tomatoes and lettuce)

### Notes
Adapted from a recipe on allrecipies.com. Make sure to salt the mushroom adequatly, no amount of marinade will save it otherwise.
