## Instructions

<!-- list the steps below -->

- Make the dressing (combine all, whisking is easiest)
- Combine all the ingredients (besides the dressing)
- Add dressing, mix to combine

### Notes

<!-- write any loose notes below -->

You can add any other toppings you want, I’m sure many things would pair well. 

This is on the less creamy end, so if you want it more creamy just add more mayo. If you use homemade mayo it’ll be lighter.

Could also add some grated lemon peel or lemon juice instead of the apple cider vinegar, and use honey or maple syrup instead of sugar.



Enjoy!
