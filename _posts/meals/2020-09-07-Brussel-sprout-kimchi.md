Crunchier than cabbage kimchi! Definitely not traditional and pretty customizable. I didn't include the fermentation time.

## Ingredients

- Vegetables
  - ~ 450g brussel sprouts 
    - Can cut in half, quarters, or leave whole
    - Note: if leaving whole, then cut leaves but not all the way through the core so the sauce can penetrate [(like brad does here)](https://youtu.be/35Y06i7HnVo?t=147)
  - 1/2 cup shredded apple or pear
  - A few scallions (1 small onion works too)
  - ~ 1 cup red cabbage (can omit or use other cabbage)
- Sauce/dressing thing
  - 5 cloves garlic
  - 1" ginger
  - 10 g crushed red pepper flakes
  - 5g chilli powder
  - 2 tbsp fish sauce
  - 1 tbsp oyster sauce
  - 1 tbsp soy sauce
  - 1 tsp sesame oil
  - 1.5% salt by weight

## Instructions

## <!-- list the steps below -->

- Sauce: add all ingredients to blender and blend 
  - It doesn't need to be completely smooth, just mostly incorporated
  - Can blend the onion with the sauce if you don't want whole pieces
  - Blending isn't necessary, but I prefer it1
- Spread the sauce into a bowl with the vegetables and work the sauce into it
  - Especially if you keep the brussel sprouts whole, make sure to work into individual layers 
- Pack everything into mason jars tightly, leaving some room at the top
- Add enough water to cover 
- Let sit (ideally in the sun or a warm ish place) for about a week
  - Depends on your personal preference and will take longer if you have bigger brussel sprout pieces
  - Make sure to burb (daily or more often depending on how packed the mason jars are)

### Notes

### <!-- write any loose notes below -->

- Scale the amount of dressing depending on if you add more or less vegetables 
  - The amount in the recipe is for ~ 700g of vegetables
- Can be served with bahn mi, bibimbap, fried egg, etc.!
- You can keep it in the fridge for a while (I kept it for two months)
- Adapted from brad!



Enjoy!
