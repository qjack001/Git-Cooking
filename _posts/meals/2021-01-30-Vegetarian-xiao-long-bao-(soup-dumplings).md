## Instructions

1. Make the aspic at least three hours ahead of when you wish to start making dumplings. To do this, simmer all soup base ingredients in a good homemade veggie stock for around 45 minutes. Other spices or some form of fat can be added to taste if the broth doesn't have enough umami. 
2. Once you are satisfied with the flavor of the stock, dissolve agar agar or gelatin (only if you're a lax vegetarian lol) in some warm water and then mix in to your soup base in a shallow dish. Refrigerate until you have a soup jello.
3. Mix all filling ingredients along with small cubes of aspic until you have a homogenous mixture. Refrigerate until you are ready to start folding dumplings
4. To make the dough, mix the flour with warm water and salt until homogenous and then let it rest in a covered bowl for ten minutes. 
5. To make skins, roll out chunks of dough through a pasta maker until you reach the 6th knob and cut circles with a large glass/circular cookie cutter.  
6. Place a small amount of filling in the center of each skin and pleat into the soup dumpling shape. 
7. Steam for 8-10 minutes, depending on dumpling size.    

### Notes
- Generally you want to try to have enough aspic that your filling is 1/3 to 1/2 soup jelly to meat. You will want more than you think if you want really soupy dumplings, because the filling and skins will absorb some of the soup. 
- The good news with making vegetarian dumplings is that you can taste the meat filling for seasoning as you go, which I would highly recommend to make sure it is adequatly salty and balanced when it comes to components like sesame oil and green onions. 
- adding leftover milk solids from making ghee or just some plain ghee goes a long way in increasing the dumpling's richness 
- unless you have been making dumpling skins for years or have a pasta machine to roll them out for you I do not recommend trying to make them at home. This recipie is already annoyingly time consuming
- that being said, the good part of making skins yourself is size control. I recommend making them slightly larger than you think you'll need to make your life easier when folding the dumplings.
