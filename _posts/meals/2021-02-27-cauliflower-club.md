Originally vegan and for the challenge, this recipe uses breaded cauliflower for a chicken nugget-like club. If you want it to be vegan, go with the vegan-mayo and carrot bacon options, and substitute cheese with a [nutritional yeast sauce](https://elavegan.com/easy-vegan-cheese-sauce-recipe/) (honestly, not recommended). However, I think it works really well as a semi-vegan take on the [classic chicken club](https://git-cook.net/meals/chicken-club).

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400ºF and place parchment paper onto two baking sheets
1. Cut cauliflower head into bite-sized pieces
2. In a bowl, mix the milk, flour, and spices, and in a seprate bowl, add the breadcrumbs
3. Dip the cauliflower pieces in the batter, then into the panko breadcrumbs, and place on the baking sheet
4. Cook in the oven for 20-25 minutes
5. Place the bacon in a cold pan set to medium-heat, turning over occasionally — or prepare the [carot bacon](https://git-cook.net/treats/carrot-bacon) if you are using that (go for 2 slices per club)
6. Slice the tomato thinly and break off a few pieces of lettuce, set aside
7. When the bacon is at a satisfactory crispy-ness, set aside and mayo-fry your buns on low heat in the same pan
8. Once everything is ready, melt a bit of cheese in a cup in the microwave
9. Assemble the club:
	- Place 4 or 5 Cauliflower pieces on the bun
	- Coat in an excessive amount of *Frank's Red Hot*
	- Pour the melted cheese on top
	- Add 2 slices of bacon
	- Add a few slices of tomato, sprinkle with salt and pepper
	- Add a piece of lettace and the top bun
